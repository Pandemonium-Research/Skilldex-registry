// Skillset coherence — ported from skilldex's src/core/skillset-coherence.ts.
//
// NOTE: This check is duplicated in skilldex and skilldex-registry, like the two validators
// beside it. Keep both in sync manually; tests/unit/conformance-corpus.test.ts pins them to
// the same answers so a divergence fails on whichever side drifted.
//
// WHY THE REGISTRY COMPUTES THIS RATHER THAN TRUSTING THE CLI
// Skillsets reach the registry through exactly one door — POST /skillsets — unlike skills,
// which are also batch-scraped by the nightly sync. It is therefore tempting to let
// `skillpm skillset publish` compute coherence and submit the number. It isn't safe: the
// API is the trust boundary, not the CLI, and any holder of a publish token can POST a
// coherence score of their choosing. Since coherence is stored sortable, a self-reported
// value is a forgeable ranking signal. Computing it here costs one fetch per member plus one
// per shared asset — 5 extra calls for the `developer` skillset — against a 5,000/hr
// authenticated GitHub budget on an endpoint that runs interactively. That is affordable in
// a way the 1.6M-row skills path never was.
//
// HOW THE PORT DIFFERS FROM THE CLI
// skilldex reads a working tree; the registry has a GitHub tree listing plus fetched blobs.
// The parsing functions below are the CLI's logic unchanged — tests/unit/skillset-coherence.test.ts
// pins the behaviour, and both implementations were diffed function-by-function and run against
// every real skillset to confirm identical output. Only I/O is abstracted, behind CoherenceSource:
// existence becomes a set lookup rather than a stat, and asset listing is sorted rather than
// readdir-ordered (readdir is unordered by contract, so a server needs a reproducible choice).
